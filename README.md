# Basic project
Basic website project boilerplate  

## Browser support
Every single piece of code in this project was tested in:

- Chrome 52  
- Firefox 43 (and developer edition 45)  
- IE 10  
- Opera 27  
- Edge  

If your browser support is lower than IE10 and/or different from the test kit, you need to change the values in the browserSupport array inside `gulp.config.js` file.
